Cryptowall protects you against SCAM Sites in the Cryptospace. If you try to reach a suspicious site, we show you a warning, and you can not enter the site. The database grows each day, and we improve the add-ons.

If you want to report a domain which is not in our database you can do it on. https://www.cryptowall.ch
